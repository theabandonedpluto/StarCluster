# StarCluster Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the unsupervised learning course in a master's degree program. The objective of this project is to analyze star clusters using unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aim is to identify and classify stars into different clusters based on their coordinates.

## Features
The Star Cluster Analysis project offers the following features:

#### Data Visualization
This project places a strong emphasis on data visualization. A 3D interactive map is utilized to visualize the movement of star clusters over time. By mapping the coordinates of stars in three dimensions, users can gain insights into the structure and dynamics of the star clusters.

#### K-means Clustering
The K-means clustering algorithm is employed to partition stars into distinct clusters based on their coordinates. By specifying the number of desired clusters, the algorithm assigns stars to the nearest cluster centroid. This allows for the identification and grouping of stars with similar characteristics.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the star cluster dataset. By transforming the original coordinates into a lower-dimensional space, PCA identifies the most informative features and captures the variance of the data. This aids in visualizing and understanding the underlying structure of the star clusters.
